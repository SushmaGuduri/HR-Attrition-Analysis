# -HR Attrition Analysis with Hypothesis Testing

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze employee attrition using a dataset of HR data. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors contributing to employee attrition, such as age, job satisfaction, and income, using hypothesis testing. The project also includes clustering to better understand employee groups based on these attributes.

## Introduction

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for many companies. This project seeks to investigate various factors that influence attrition, such as:
- Age
- Monthly income
- Job satisfaction
- Department differences
- Hypothesis testing was used to determine whether specific features had a significant impact on employee turnover.

## Dataset
The dataset includes key employee information such as:

- Age
- Monthly income (log-transformed)
- Job satisfaction score
- Attrition status

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)

- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square)

- Clustering (KMeans)

- Jupyter Notebooks

## Analysis

- The project involved the following steps:

## Data preprocessing:

- cleaning and transformation of variables.

## Hypothesis testing:

- Testing the difference in attrition rates across departments.

- Testing if income or job satisfaction significantly affects attrition.

## Clustering:

- Applying KMeans clustering to group employees by age, income, and job satisfaction.

- Visualization of key findings using Python libraries.

## Results

- The main findings of this analysis include:

- Statistically significant relationships between attrition and job satisfaction.

- No significant difference in attrition rates between departments.

- Cluster analysis revealed groups of employees based on their income and job satisfaction levels.
